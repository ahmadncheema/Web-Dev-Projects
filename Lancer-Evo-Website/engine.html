                <h1>The Legendary 4G63-T</h1><br>
                <p>
                    The 4G63 was a 1,997 cc (2.0 L) version. Bore x stroke is 85 mm × 88 mm (3.35 in × 3.46 in) SOHC and DOHC were produced. 
                    Both versions were available in either naturally aspirated and turbocharged form. For front-wheel drive applications, the turbocharged Sirius' name was changed to "Cyclone Dash". 
                    As fitted to the fifth generation Galant 200 PS (147 kW; 197 bhp) JIS gross were claimed - the output claims later shrank to 170 PS (125 kW; 168 bhp) - for the turbocharged and intercooled "Sirius Dash 3x2 valve" engine. 
                    This version could switch between breathing through two or three valves per cylinder, to combine high top-end power with low-end drivability as well as allowing for economical operation. 
                    It was a modification of Mitsubishi MCA-Jet technology which used a secondary intake valve to inject air into the engine for more efficient emissions control.
